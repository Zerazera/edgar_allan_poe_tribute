        Edgar Allan Poe was the earliest known writer who attempted to make a living out of doing so (though at this he failed, living miserably and in much poverty). Among his achievements is inventing the detective fiction genre and contributing to the then-new science-fiction genre. He also had a strong influence on the horror genre. At times humorous, at times quite macabre, Poe managed to build up an impressive bibliography, including poems and short stories. Poe's writing style and influence extended well past his death, drawing imitators and admirers alike. Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of a series of books starring Sherlock Holmes, drew great inspiration from Poe's work.

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "…[Poe's] tales were one of the great landmarks and starting points in the literature of the last century… For those tales have been so pregnant with suggestion, so stimulating to the minds of others, that it may be said of many of them that each is a root from which a whole literature has developed."
            </p>

      The poem which made Poe famous is "The Raven", published in January 1845. This notable poem has been an inspiration to many later authors, including Vladimir Nabakov, Bernard Malamud, and Ray Bradbury.<br><br>                             Below are the first two stanzas of "The Raven". However, they are not in order. Rearrange them so they are. Try it without looking up the poem!<br>Note that the blank line is to separate the stanzas.<br><br>
        <ul class='list-group'>
        <li id='4'>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</li>
        <li id='11'>From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—</li>
        <li id='1'>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</li>
        <li id='5'>“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—</li>
        <li id='13'>Nameless <em>here</em> for evermore.</li>
        <li id='2'>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—</li>
        <li id='10'>Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow</li>
        <li id='12'>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—</li>
        <li id='8'>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;</li>
        <li id='3'>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</li>
        <li id='6'>Only this and nothing more.”</li>
        <li id='9'>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</li>
        <li id='7'></li>
        </ul>
